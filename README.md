### File Naming Conventions

Each problem will be organized within a structured folder hierarchy as follows:

1. **Year Folder**: Named after the year (e.g., `2024`).
2. **Month Folder**: Located inside the year folder, named after the month (e.g., `August`).
3. **Division Folder**: Located inside the month folder, named after the respective division.

#### File Naming Format:
```
[division_name][problem_name]s[n].[file_extension]
```

- **`[division_name]`**: The name of the division.  
- **`[problem_name]`**: The specific name of the problem.  
- **`s[n]`**: Indicates the number of test cases passed.  
    - If **`s[n]`** is not specified, it means the problem passed **all test cases**.  
- **`[file_extension]`**: The appropriate file extension (e.g., `.py`, `.cpp`, `.java`).
